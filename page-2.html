      <p>
        In total, there are 134 winter trails and 21 summer trails on the
        panorama mountain. The runs are seperated into 4 different types: easy
        trails are green circles, intermediate trails are blue squares, hard
        trails are black diamonds, and very hard trials are double black
        diamonds! This is a great place to go even if you are new to
        skiing/snowboarding since there is a bunny hill as well as a run meant
        for getting used to it. Panorama also offers a service called rk heliski
        where they put you in a helicopter to fly you up the Purcell mountain to
        ski down. A similar service is the monster X snowcat where you get on a
        snowcat shuttle that takes you to the top of the Taynton bowl.

      <h3 id="favorite-trails">My favorite trails</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Showoff. A run with a lot of jumps and a good place for speed.</li>
        <li>Schuber's dream. The run where i broke my arm a few years ago.</li>
        <li>
          Village way. You can get to extremely fast speeds on this trail.
        </li>
        <li>Taynton trail. you have to take a few black diamonds to get here, 
          but it is worth it for the scenery and the speed.</li>

      skiing/snowboarding in winter and biking in summer.
