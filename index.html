      My name is Ashton and my family has been visiting the Panorama Mountain Resort every 3rd week
      of January for many years. We go here primarily for the skiing, but even if you don't ski, there 
      are many more things to do. This page will provide some tips for anyone
      wanting to visit and will show the many things you can do at this resort.
