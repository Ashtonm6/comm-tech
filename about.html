        If you choose to visit this resort, it is recommended that you find a
        place to stay. In the village, there are studio and loft style condos
        that you can rent for any amount of time. My family has a timeshare for
        a condo in the village. There are also hotels as well as privately ownes
        houses to rent. you can also stay in invermere close to the resort. It
        is recommended to find a place to stay close to the hill because most of
